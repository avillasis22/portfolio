         <p class="portfolioCaption">Aidan's interest in photography was sparked in 2018 after taking an introductory photography class. Since then, he has continued developing a photography portfolio throughout high school. Under the guidance of photographer Pete Capano, Aidan has developed a unique photographic style and continues to strengthen his skills. These pictures, all of which were shot on mobile phones, are the culmination of his work.</p>
