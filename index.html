            Hi, I'm Aidan. I am an incoming student at the University of Pittsburgh with a lifelong fascination for both technology and visual arts. The merger of these interests is reflected in the portfolios and other works showcased on this hub.

      <!--<p class="portfolioAnimation"><a class="portfolio photographyPortfolio" href="/photography/" target="_blank">Photography</a></p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioCaption">Aidan's interest in photography was sparked in 2018 after taking an introductory photography class. Since then, he has continued developing a photography portfolio throughout high school. Under the guidance of photographer Pete Capano, Aidan has developed a unique photographic style and continues to strengthen his skills. These pictures, all of which were shot on mobile phones, are the culmination of his work.</p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioAnimation"><a class="portfolio lungcancerPortfolio" href="/lungcancer/" target="_blank">Lung Cancer PSA</a></p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioCaption">Aidan was able to combine his interests in art, computers, and biology through designing a website to serve as a PSA and help educate people about lung cancer.</p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioAnimation"><a class="portfolio creativewritingPortfolio" href="/writing/" target="_blank">Creative Writing</a></p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioCaption">With over 12 years of English writing experience (from Kindergarten until present) and over three years of high school writing, Aidan has developed and fine-tuned his creative style. The works shown are an assortment of creative, narrative, and analytical writings from 12th grade.</p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioAnimation"><a class="portfolio villustratorsPortfolio" href="https://villustrators.com" target="_blank">Villustrators</a></p>-->
      <!--<p class="portfolioCaption final">As a way to give back to the community during COVID, Aidan and his brother started a sign-making business with proceeds donated to Face to Face, a local charity that provides many services to community members in need. Aidan also designed and manages the website.</p>-->
