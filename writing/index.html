         <h1 class="settingStoryTitleTest">Are you Jocelyn?</h1>
         <p class="indent">He walked with a certain ease - not necessarily of disregard for his surroundings and whereabouts, but the ease of someone careless; he seemed it from his strut, gradually swaying as he walked, his feet outstretched only slightly but enough to be a noticeable feature of his stride. His back was hunched despite there being no weight atop it: he carried a jet black suitcase and no bags. His sleeves were rolled to his knuckles, and eyes stoic and downward facing  - distant but not disdainful.  Around his neck, concealed by his top, he had a silver locket containing a note. “You’ve got a daughter, Roy. Jocelyn. She’s got the most beautiful green eyes you’ll ever see. I’ll see you in 19 days,” it read. The only flashy attribute of his presentation was a watch he wore backwards but made special attention to conceal: it was a deep gold, like the walls of Versailles, a tone his taste would usually deem tacky. Regardless, he wore it. It was once his father’s and his father’s before him. His odd walk, though, rarely attracted any attention; others of the school were far too preoccupied in their business to notice it. He was discrete as he passed them, noticing their conversations morph. As they went past, their once-distinct words gradually melted together, moulding into an indiscernible mesh of nonsensical chatter. He observed this but thought nothing of it. It simply was how things are meant to be.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">He found solace in nature but had little opportunity to indulge himself in its many awe-inspiring facets. Occasionally, when time permitted, he would immerse himself in the sliver of the outdoors he could reach with two odd strides. He sat at a bench that over the years he had become intimately familiar with. An ovular groove in the metal plaque embedded into its back was a permanent reminder of that intimacy. The bench lay overlooking the boundary of the school, the blissful rolling hills of a golf course occupying the majority of his view.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">Sitting there one evening, he recalled a time his father brought him to a great starlit mound behind his house. He recalled its snow-covered figure completely uninterrupted, so smooth it almost seemed to reflect the moon’s shimmering gaze. In a blood red wheelbarrow that appeared a nightly black under the spill of darkness he sat, being dragged along by his father who trenched through the snow with the wheelbarrow behind. The dreamy whiteness of the world became gashed in their tracks; the tires of the wheelbarrow distorted the purity of the mound, revealing dirt. He remembered reaching its top and looking over to his house. It seemed distant yet indescribably familiar. His father pushed him and the wheelbarrow down the mound, its perfect white smoothness corrupting in their destructive, blissful wake.

         </div>-->
         <p class="indent">The snow-covered mound of his memory then rapidly vanished, disrupted by the presence of a young girl crunching leaves which littered the unkempt sidewalk as she made her way around the bench. Walking past, she noticed the man’s stoic gaze but did not regard it. She was clearly distraught; the man could tell from the faux confidence in her stride and the hollowness of her emerald green eyes. He looked up as she passed, following her jittery figure with curiosity. She was dressed entirely in black and looked downward as he did in the school halls though lacking his ease. As she walked onward, the sound of her footsteps, of crunching and cackling autumn leaves, gradually dissipated, becoming faint and then indistinguishable from the distant hum of the nightly breeze. As quickly as she had appeared, she had vanished.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">The girl continued her evening walks around that golf course for some months, seeing the man sat at his bench but never greeting him. She did however notice the many facets of his character. She saw his suitcase, his watch, the ID card buttoned to his shirt, the loosened tie around his neck, and his locket. He seemed to always grasp his locket tightly whenever she passed. Her mother used to carry a locket as well. In that way, the man seemed familiar, and it was familiarity that the girl sought at that golf course. Her mother too used to walk the brick pathway surrounding those lush green hills, though when they did so together, the silence between them was chilling.
         </p>
         <p class="indent indentFinal">One particularly somber night, lantern lights spilled glittering luminescences upon the bench where the man sat, transforming the pure whiteness of the snow atop his eyelids into shimmering gold fragments like broken glass. That night, the man’s ease was gone. He waited under a golden coat of fluttering snow for that burdened girl to walk by, for the sound of her black crunching boots to echo throughout the hollow and empty nighttime air, announcing the presence of his daughter. He clenched the cold locket around his neck, imagining her sterile green eyes; he saw in those eyes familiarity, which he — like her — ultimately sought, sitting on that bench just over the golf course, its green hills now engulfed by a white blanket of undisturbed purity. The man held the locket until the warmth of his hands gave it new life, until it too shimmered gold under the lantern light. He sat, shivering and imagining, until the girl emerged with craters of disturbed snow behind her, revealing dirt and marking her path - isolating her. She was dressed in midnight black as she walked through the cold whiteness of winter. As the man lifted his head towards the girl, golden snow gracefully struck the ground, creating tiny mounds atop his boots. She pretended not to notice him. The girl continued to walk; in her wake, sole-shaped splotches of darkness interrupted the smooth illuminating surface of the hill. The man could now see the green of her eyes: amongst the whiteness of the world, they almost seemed to glow. He stood up, the snow upon his shoulders and legs tumbled downward, and met her gaze. She stopped and looked away quickly so as to seem confused, but it was only an act. She knew exactly why he stood, exactly why he sat at that bench. The girl then turned her head upward, the lantern light obfuscating her vision as she squinted back into the old man’s golden eyes. Squeezing the locket in his coat pocket as he trembled before the girl, he asked, “Jocelyn. Are you Jocelyn? Is that your name?” The girl hesitated, her pale face no longer hid any faux confidence. “No,” she replied, “I’m sorry. That’s not me.”

         <h1 class="narrativeNonfictionTitleTest storyTwo">Gallo Del Cielo</h1>
         <div class="gradientGalloDelCielo">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As a youth, Carlos Zaragoza had never seen his father’s face. His mother, the only person for whom he had ever cared, lay still atop a makeshift bed built from wooden planks and hay. Her pale skin was cold to the touch and her breath was faint. Soon, he thought, he would be alone. The boy wanted to buy back the land stolen from his family long before. He wanted his mother to once again see the sun rise over Puerto Princesa, to assure that she would not die with the tingle of dried grass hidden behind her back. He wanted her to die in her own home.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp On a clear night, Zaragoza walked through the glowing city of Makati. Its great towers pierced the heavens and sprinkled glistening colors through the sky. In one pocket of his cargo shorts, he had his mother’s faded leather wallet, 50,000 pesos inside, and a small sheet of paper with directions leading to a fighting pit shakily drawn. There, he thought, 50,000 pesos would ride upon the fate of those sparring roosters until they turned to 1,000,000. In his other pocket, he had an unlocked balisong which rattled with each step. He jingled as he made his way down the streets. The distant-then-close whirring of cars brought him close to the edge of the sidewalk; he was curious to hear their sounds and see the people within them. He continued and the once-shimmering lights became sterile and casted blotches of yellow upon the unkempt pavement. Under this yellow haze, as if it had emerged from the night itself, a charcoal rooster appeared in front of the young Zaragoza and the jingling of his balisong ceased abruptly. The rooster stood confidently, its midnight coat reflected no yellow, manifesting only the darkness of night, a darkness he had become intimately familiar with. He bent down, squatting, and saw the whites of his eyes assimilate within the void of the rooster’s, its black pupils indistinct from the shadow casted by its proud crescent feathers. It remained still as Zaragoza shifted forward, only tilting its head as if to greet him. He cautiously extended both arms toward the bird until he could feel the stiffness of its feathers against his palm. He said to the rooster, “Gallo Del Cielo. That is your name” and lifted it above the ground. Del Cielo flapped his wings for but a second and was then again still in Zaragoza’s hands. “You will get my mother her land.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza followed the dimming yellow lights, now dull and mucky, taking Del Cielo across the city to a fighting pit. The shrill scream of roosters drowned the chatter of men in the stands. Overhead lights flooded the fighting sand with bright colorless fluorescence. No more did glistening colors illuminate the night sky. No more did the sound of cars echo throughout the heavy city air. The night was now black and only the blindingly lit sand was distinct against the misty tropical haze. Zaragoza placed Del Cielo down onto the sand outside of the arena. He reached into his pocket, feeling the bite of his blade graze his finger as he drew the knife in his right hand. A drop of red fell upon Del Cielo’s black coat as his hand left his pocket. Zaragoza yanked the drawstring of his shorts and cut the base using the knife. He then lifted Del Cielo to the sky, his nightly wings spread over Zaragoza's outstretched skyward facing arm, and wrapped the bloody drawstring around the balisong and Del Cielo’s pale leg, attaching it to his right spur.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza brought Del Cielo to the arena’s border. He did not speak as he handed his 50,000 pesos away, only looking into the lonely eyes of the man who many called “the bank.” He felt a ghastly sickness come about him as he entered the arena with the calm Del Cielo nestled under his arm. The grey rooster directly adjacent Del Cielo squirmed in Zaragoza’s opponents’ hands, screeching. His opponent had a certain easiness in his eyes, the confidence of a man familiar with this sport. Zaragoza looked down toward Del Cielo who seemed unburdened, peacefully and silently taunting his opponent. His mother’s land now silently sat atop the bite of Del Cielo’s spur. He imagined running home and not stopping; not stopping for the city lights or the sounds of the cars or fighting pits, without his knife and without burden, to present to his mother the bloody Del Cielo in his arms, the savior Gallo Del Cielo, who had brought back her land. A man shuffled quickly to the center of the pit and looked at both roosters, grinning at Del Cielo’s crude silver spur minted with the blood of Zaragoza. He stepped back and without delay, raised his arm outward. The faint and sudden cry of his whistle quickly dissolved amidst the yelling of men.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Zaragoza released Del Cielo and he fluttered to the ground, the balisong flapping and jingling as he descended. His skyward-bound opponent cast a moving shadow over the cowering figure of Del Cielo as he drove a steel-mounted blade across his breast. Black feathers tinted red flew across the sand. Del Cielo, with a maroon-stained gash through his front, flapped his dark wings -- sand circling beneath him, distorting the white pit’s strange uniformity -- and met the grey rooster far above his fallen feathers. The overhead fluorescence glistened against the silver of Del Cielo’s blade as it sunk into his opponent's chest, glowing specks of red masked the greyness of his breast as they descended to the ground. Del Cielo struck the ground and would not rise again. Zaragoza’s dream which lay upon his reddened spur was dragged through the sand as Del CIelo hollered a piercing scream. The signal man ran to separate the sparring roosters, shaking them both before raising the grey one by his barely-feathered neck to the sky.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Zaragoza, with stillness in his eyes, walked into the pit towards the trembling Del Cielo, who could see but not move to acknowledge him. He crouched over Del Cielo, covering the rooster’s enfeebled body under the nightly coat of his own shadow, and stared into his once bold eyes. He could not run home to his mother now, he could not bring her anything but the blood of the lost Del Cielo. He could not free her nor could he free himself. His pocket was now empty and his mother’s land lost; she would die atop her bed of wood and hay. Zaragoza reached out towards and clutched the neck of the frail bird with two smothering palms, shaking his bobbing head savagely. Del Cielo then, as if by the will of God, extended his blood painted wings to reveal an untouched charcoal underside. He fluttered, kicking grains into Zaragoza’s still eyes and, in a single swiping motion, sunk the red mounted balisong deep into the boy’s chest. He collapsed to the ground, unable to cry and with Del Cielo’s black choking head in his hand.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Frogs were humming and crickets were chirping on a humid summer night on the outskirts of the city of Makati. Carlos Zaragoza sat atop two stacked palm tree stumps, his back straight against an upright tire, and looked through a hole in the rusted tin walls of his home. The moonlight outlined the elegant figure of a jet black rooster, its head proudly pointed towards the heavens and its shadowy feathers untouched by even the sand upon the ground. Zaragoza, under the moon’s dim blanket of light, looked down towards his chest and into the remnants of a deep cavernous scar which covered it. The maroon gash ran deep through his muddy skin and had hardened into a bone-like ridge atop his chest. With every breath he took, Zaragoza felt silver spurs pierce his skin and grapple bone. He looked up again into the darkness but the rooster had vanished into the thick brush of night. His brown eyes narrowed and a wildness took his face. He slowly rose from his makeshift chair of stumps and tires with his back slouched and his neck bent forward. Zaragoza yelled into the night, the gash swelling and pulsating as he coughed out a bloody curse to Gallo Del Cielo. He collapsed, falling to the ground as his frail hands plunged into the sand, kicking grains into his squinting eyes. Then he was still, his face firmly planted in the sand floor of his home. He lay there, the first time he had felt matter upon his face in many years, and once again imagined the blade mounted to Cielo’s spurs piercing his chest as he tried to slow his breathing, to escape the slow pecking beak of misfortune.

         <h1 class="narrativeNonfictionTitleTest storyTwo">Blue Marble</h1>
         <div class="gradientGalloDelCielo">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The expanse was a wondrous place. Space, they said, was an opportunity. Its horizons limitless, its wonder a glory to experience. It was the next phase of our species, naturally. From land to sea and now to here. We voyaged distances our ancestors but a few generations past would find simply impossible. Our technology to some curious species would seem to work by way of magic. Of course, they would never see the gleam of our Alcubierre reactors, the sound of our whirring sensors, the little ding the food replicators make when they’ve finished materializing a hot meal. They sit in ignorance, those species, while we gleefully soar above their skies, peering down through long-range optical sensors. That’s what space is for, right?
            <br><br><br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The cold silver hull of the N.S.S. Intrepid illuminated the darkness, her windows like tiny stars among the trillions which encompassed everything around her, which encompassed us. I looked to those stars and once saw hope. Back then, while on the Intrepid, I was still hopeful. I saw the wonder of space, of our creations.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We were on a mission that day, to patrol the Union-Llanan neutral zone. Union intelligence suspected Llanan incursions around the outskirts of Union space and sent us, the Intrepid, to assess their intentions. Intrepid was a classified project: the first Earth vessel designed to simultaneously operate as a science-exploratory cruiser and part-time warship. Her sleek profile was perhaps unassuming but her armaments: anything but. Her registry did not bear a Union insignia; that was to shift the blame, to not bruise the Union’s reputation if she were caught in any sort of unfortunate predicament. We, her crew, were alone.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Intrepid sailed gracefully at Alcubierre factor 10 towards the neutral zone. Her newly-christened hull barely rumbling as she cut through the space around her. Blue distortions folded and unfolded about her wake in a sort of beautiful chaos, rippled space trailing her elegant frame.
            <br><br><br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp About an hour after leaving the Sol system, she abruptly exited the Alcubierre stream, crashing back into the wondrously chaotic reality of space. Emergency quad-axial thrusters fired hot flame as she realigned herself, spinning to a sudden halt.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Captain, I’ve lost helm control. The ship, I don’t know, it put itself into emergency stop without my authorization,” my first officer Alice Ore said, rapidly tapping her navigation console attempting to run a diagnostic program: a futile task I realized.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Sir, I am getting a reading I don’t quite understand. Originating from an H-Class planet. Undesignated. This planet is uncharted, actually, sir. There is nothing on file, anywhere,” Lieutenant Wilson looked towards me and said, inadvertently requesting my approval. That lieutenant wanted to know everything, to have all his questions answered. I couldn’t blame the boy. He was fresh out of the academy, after all, manning his first post; an unfortunate first post to man.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked at him and nodded. “Run continuous sensor sweeps and engage cloak. Go to condition yellow, Lieutenant,” I said, shifting my head toward Commander Ore. “You, meet me in my office,” I told her; my eyes narrow and hers curious yet clearly distraught.
We walked off the bridge together, the remaining bridge crew unsure but unable to question, at least not through their lips. Their rank and mine is what kept them quiet and me alive.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Commander,” I said, sitting down across from her at my desk, its glass frame scattering little bits of light all around the room. “if we were on a Union Starship, you would not be sitting here right now. Unfortunately, you’ve been placed in a unique predicament. What we discuss here does not leave this room; do I make myself clear?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Captain?” She asked with an eyebrow now slightly raised.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Computer, show me an Epsilon particle. Yes, I do authorize this command.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The computer obliged. On the office viewscreen, a simple atomic diagram appeared, rotating seemingly at will.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “This is Epsilon, I said. ” It’s a new way to imagine energy, Commander. One Epsilon molecule has an approximate energy yield of over 10,000 Alcubierre reactor cores. Just one nanometer is enough to generate the equivalent power of an entire Dyson sphere. Union intelligence on old Alga-4 had been working to develop a stable Epsilon molecule for nearly 20 years. Their program at first ran entirely on the basis of computer simulations. They then moved to replicating Epsilon particles through atomic restructuring which yielded the results they wanted. When they attempted to extract Epsilon’s power, however, well, that was the last of Alga-4. The badlands, have you ever wondered how they came about?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “My God,” she said. “I conducted a survey on this asteroid in the badlands. I was still a cadet at the time so perhaps that’s partly to blame but we had to abort our mission because our pilot was inexperienced. She couldn’t fly our little Runabout through all the subspace ruptures. You’re telling me those ruptures came about artificially? From this Epsilon?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Ever wondered why all ships have to run on impulse power there? Why Alcubierre drives are inoperable within a 12 lightyear radius of Alga-4? That was from a single Epsilon molecule in a highly controlled environment. We still don’t know exactly why the incident occurred, but we do know that Epsilon is far too dangerous to toy with.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I suppose the ship has found Epsilon here. In this world then,” she said, looking toward me to validate her reasoning, one arm over the other.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “If this were a Union ship, I’d be in contact with High Command right now. We’d be assessing our options. But, as you’re aware, we operate quite differently than they do. We’re the guys they’d send to fix the issue anyhow. Can’t have Union registered ships flying around harassing other advanced civilizations. Leave that to the unregistereds. Also can’t have Union officers going around running their mouths about this Epsilon thing.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I suppose you’re right,” she said.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You, Commander, I trust you.” I took off my hat and placed it atop my lap.“I require your judgment.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She began to mutter, “I don’t know of how much assistance I can be.“
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “That’s an order, Ore. Now you trust me.” I said to her sternly, catching in the corner of my vision that green and blue planet. How strange our cloak made the outside look. I was well acquainted with the shimmer of Intrepid’s silver hull gleaming against the backdrop of nebulae in all sorts of fascinating shades. There was no gleam now: only a vast emptiness which enveloped that world, that enveloped us and everything else.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A buzz came through above my office door. “Captain, we’ve found something.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked to the little red buzzer. “On my way”, I said, taking the hat from my lap and putting it back onto my head. I made my way to the bridge, Ore trailing me. The automatically sliding transparent doors marked my entrance. Dim lit yellow lights coated their faces, the crew’s, in a sort of golden aura.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Report,” I said in faux confidence, eyeing the Lieutenant manning the helm.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Sir, there is a huge energy buildup… It, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before. There are neutrino emissions coming from that planet as if there’s a wormhole directly in its core. I’ve tried multiphase scans, everything, sir. This is like nothing anybody has ever seen before. I suggest we contact Union Intelligence right away.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I could sense Ore’s eyes tracing my hand, cuffed behind my back. It was being watched, I could feel it. I couldn’t move it from its position. She was waiting, like a puppy does waiting to be fed, but she didn’t leap and yap as those animals do. She stood patiently, attentively, at ease. She spoke no words, at least not from her mouth.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Your orders, Captain?,” the Lieutenant inquired.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Disable all external comms, Lieutenant. From this point forward, do not execute commands without my direct approval, is that understood?” I said, turning and again gesturing to Ore to return to my office.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Yes sir,” replied the Lieutenant.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The automatically sliding doors again marked our exit.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Intrepid was invisible. Her silver hull no longer glistened in the sunlight. Her windows no longer split the blackness of space into thousands of speckled light particles as she soared past. There was nothing, a void was all. A void and that planet, rather. That damned planet.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Commander, we cannot permit Epsilon to exist,” I said to Ore from across that elegant glass desk once again.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Well, it does.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You shouldn’t have any say in it, really. Knowledge of Epsilon is restricted to clearance level 11, you know. You only know beca-”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Because we’re not Union officers, I know,” she said, her stance unwavering.” We run things differently. Yes. And you need a second pair of eyes. To make sure you don’t mess up. So let’s quit the funny business. Epsilon exists. What do we do about it?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “We eliminate it. That’s what Union Intelligence ordered us to do. The Epsilon directive is what it’s called. It overrides the Non-Intervention Protocol.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Eliminate it?” She asked inquisitively.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “This ship is equipped with 3 bicobalt detonators,” I said. “We have the capacity to-“
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Captain, permission to speak freely,” she said, standing from her seat. I nodded.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Are you out of your damned mind? You’re talking about killing billions. Murdering them. Innocent people, you’ve never even seen before. For Christ's sake, Domien, they probably haven’t even heard of the Union.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I remained seated at the head of the glass table.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “The power they have, commander. The threat they pose not just.. not just to the Union but to the entire quadrant. It is simply intolerable. We wouldn’t see those damned neutrinos if they weren’t already testing it. They’re toying with death, with the lives of trillions. If they attempt to extract energy from Epsilon, don’t you see what will happen? Neutrino emissions don’t false project a damned wormhole into the core of a planet for no reason. They’ve got hundreds, thousands even… Of Epsilon. Remember what just one molecule did now? And as soon as they start experimenting, trying to see how to manipulate it, there will be no more Union. Hell, there will be no more quadrant.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She looked out over Intrepid through my large office window. her composure calm and simultaneously questioning. “These people could be explorers, just like us. They could be trying to save themselves. What if, Captain, what if when Botonevsky brought the Alcubierre drive to fruition, the Andonians thought the same thing you’re thinking. What if they assumed our intentions were destructive, that we’d use Alcubierre technology as a weapon. What then? What if they smote us into oblivion because our threat; no, because our potential was simply intolerable to them? The Union would never have existed. We cannot assume these people are evil; we cannot assume they’re hell-bent on destroying us, Captain.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Alcubierre is one thing,” I said, “this is another. A detonation of the quantity of Epsilon they have is enough to eradicate all life within the quadrant. And even if they don’t accidentally kill every living thing and rupture subspace throughout the quadrant, can the Union allow such a threat to exist? Epsilon has the potential to be used as the most devastating weapon anybody has ever seen. This planet alone could bring the entire Union to its knees. Not to mention the Llanans.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She took her seat again, adjusting her uniform slightly. “Llanans this, Llanans that… This is not a diplomatic issue, Captain. What you’re doing is morally wrong. What gives you the right to sentence the billions of inhabitants of this world to death? What gives you the right to play God?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “If I don’t, someone else will,” I said, now joining her in looking out the full-beam window. “And you best hope their blood is red.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Could you live with that burden, sir?” There was silence for a moment.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Big blue marble,” I said, turning back to the commander.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What?” she replied.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “That’s what they used to call Earth. Big blue marble. That’s what I see through that window. Home. I used to stargaze back on Earth, as a kid. Whenever I had the time. I’d go out and just lay down on this big grass mound at my grandpa’s place and look up for hours. I wanted to go there, to touch the stars. I wanted to explore everything. Well now I’m here and all I see is that big blue marble. Those people on that planet, I don’t know if they’re different from us. I don’t know who they pray to, who they love; I don’t know if there’s some kid down there looking back up at me. Waiting. But I know that if I leave them here today, I’ll regret it.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Captain-“
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Thank you Commander but I’ve made my decision,” I said smiling as I adjusted my eyes from her sharp gaze. It was a faux smile.
            <br><br><br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp That big blue marble. It was a stark contrast against the void behind it, above it, around it. Its natural magnificence dwarfed anything artificial. The Union, in all the genius of its scientists and engineers, could never produce something that magnificent: of which our universe holds an uncountable number. Crafted by the meticulous hands of God himself, it would seem; electrified into existence by his own fruition, his own power. The planet spun in ignorance.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Clear the bridge,” I commanded sternly as I entered through the automatic sliding doors, the tick of their frame against the adjacent metal bulkhead announcing my ingress.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bridge crew did not question, they merely did. Instantaneously it would seem. It was what they were trained to do: to obey. They stood from their posts in complete silence and walked out tediously, one trailing the other, like androids. The door remained open until they all vacated. And then, it was the tick of its glass frame that announced their egress.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ore did not obey. She was again behind me, watching that quivering hand behind my back. I clenched the fist with the other, I tried to stop its sporadic movements but it was a futile task. Her eyes, I could sense them; I couldn’t see their gaze but I could feel it, her eyes carefully observing my discreetly cowering figure.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Ore, that’s an order,” I said without turning.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Captain, with all due respect, I am not leaving. And there’s nothing you can do about it. If you want me off this bridge, you’ll have to personally drag me to the brig.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She was right. She couldn’t be subject to any court-martial; the details of our mission would never leave Intrepid, her bulkheads would keep our secret. But I couldn’t let Ore stay. This burden was mine to carry and mine alone.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I knew exactly her intentions and she knew my mind was made, that there was nothing more she could do but share my burden. And I couldn’t permit even that.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I could not accept knowing Ore was compliant in what I would do and I don’t know if she could either.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Understood, Commander,” I said, making my way to the communications console. I touched it and my authorization was registered. The ultrasonic waves pierced through the sweat coating my wrinkled hand to read the peaks and troths of my fingerprint.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Security to the bridge,” I said uneasily to the computer, overriding the internal communications lockout.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Captain, please. What you’re doing, you can’t do it alone. You can’t.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I can only do it alone,” I said to her. The yellow-suited security detail arrived promptly, again activating the graceful sliding doors.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Please escort Commander Ore to the brig,” I told them. They nodded. She offered no resistance, knowing that too would be a futile task.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I hope you can live with yourself, Captain,” she said to me. I watched her hands cuffed behind her back as she left the bridge; they were no longer the hands of a Commander standing at attention. They did not quiver as mine did. They stood behind her confidently, genuinely so. The door ticked as it hit the bulkhead.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Intrepid was now my only company, the only one to bear witness to my burden. Her bridge was silent yet screamed a thousand words; a deafening sound. Her bulkheads yelled my name, the consoles gave advice I couldn’t bear to listen to, every station attacked me. They shot invisible arrows at my face, piercing my eyes and mouth. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t see nor could I hear. I could only feel the sensation of the thousand tiny bits of flesh being torn from my skin; from those grappling arrows.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I tried to open my eyes and was immediately blinded by the radiant light of that planet. It sent a warm glow about the bridge from the viewscreen. I shook my head rapidly, feeling the grip of the arrows loosening as they fell to the floor in complete silence. I looked forward and the glow was gone. The blue marble was again blue. Intrepid’s bridge was hollow and grey, dim blinking yellow lights coated the now silent consoles. The silence now was deafening. I could hear everything all at once; all of the nothing. I could feel and hear each footstep I took towards the tactical command station. I could hear the oxygen pumping beyond my ribs, through my chest and skin. That thump echoed throughout Intrepid’s vacant bridge too. Her own blood flowed throughout the bulkheads, across the bio-neural circuitry embedded in every hall panel.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I took my seat at tactical; it was the first time I’d ever manned that station. I looked down towards that console as if it were the last thing I’d ever see.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The menus and buttons a blurry mesh of red and blue and orange and all the colors of the universe; all the colors of God’s great universe spread across this metal sheet like the flowing colors of an oil painting. They spilled out onto the floor and over the cloaked hull of Intrepid, revealing her once concealed structure. I again shook my head rapidly, releasing more reddened arrows to the ground and as I did so they vanished. Opening my eyes, the console too had now regressed to its dull origin - the menus and buttons again discernible.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Computer, disengage cloak and take us within weapons range of that planet.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Her body almost unfurled, crackling powerfully as that dress of invisibility faded into the gradient of space around her. Her metallic hull again glistened in the slow-rolling beams cast from the sun which that planet so gracefully orbited.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With an uncontrollably convulsing hand, I inputted the coordinates for a weapons lock.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “On my mark, fire our full complement of bicobalt detonators,” I ordered the computer.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Something in me forced me to say it; I couldn’t input the commands into the console by my own hand. Perhaps I reasoned that it wouldn’t be my doing. By the computer’s robotic, lifeless hand those detonators would have fired. But it wouldn’t have made a difference I now realize. This burden is mine, not the computers. It is by my hand that those people... That their fate was decided.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who was I to play God? To choose who lives and who dies. Who was I to tell those people that they were too dangerous to be allowed to live? Allowed… Who was I to determine who was allowed to do anything? To exist. Who allotted me the moral obligation to save the universe? Who placed a golden pedestal below my feet?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Nobody did. I did. Everyone did.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I wondered what they did down there. Did their children frolic on huge grass-covered mounds and gleefully look up towards the stars at night. Do they dream of what lies beyond? Do they love? Do their scientists and politicians and philosophers bring home supper for their families for dinner?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked up from the command station to again see that blue marble dancing in the sky, its cities casting glowing luminescence into the night.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If it isn’t me who pulls the trigger, I thought, it would be someone else. A Union officer. A Llanan. It would be their burden too. They would bear that responsibility and they would have to live with themselves. I couldn’t permit that. I couldn’t shove the weight of a billion souls onto the shoulders of another. What would that make me if not a faux God?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I hesitated, clenching my lips shut until I was certain; certain that I was right.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Mark,” I whispered. The computer heard.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Three pulsating orbs illuminated the underside of Intrepid’s hull, sending cascading flurries through the night. They struck the planet, instantly charing its blue oceans into dark reddened dust. It was so silent. Their screams, I had expected for some odd reason to hear something. To hear someone, a child, a mother, a father, cry out but there was nothing. There was no embrace to their death. Nothing warm about it. There was no love down there, there was no hatred, no evil.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The planet’s reddened surface cracked, crumbling into bits and floating off in every direction. One gleam in the night sky would be ripped from the canvas of stars. Nobody but Intrepid and I would know of the atrocity I’d just committed. It would be a burden kept between bulkhead and flesh. I looked out towards that blue marble and no longer could I see home. No longer did the blue waves crash against the great green masses of land. I would never know the names of their continents, of their cities, or of their oceans.
            <br><br><br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Lay in a course. Anywhere.” I said, not daring to stray my gaze from the viewscreen. Orange glowing structures, the shrapnel of that magnificent world, sent dust bits across the void. There was a strange calmness to it all. A serenity I couldn’t bear.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Intrepid reversed course. Her internal aft pylons pumped blue coolant into roaring impulse engines, scattering particle luminescence about the drifting debris. She moved steadily as her nacelles assumed the blueness of the now dissipating impulse reactors. The dust was gone, outside the range of her forward-facing sensor array. The sole image occupying the viewscreen: an ocean of stars.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Intrepid took flight, entering the Alcubierre stream once again, those stars folding around her body.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I don’t know,” I said, breaking a silence between the computer and I; the only noise to supplement our conversation was the slow rumble of space. That damn computer gazed directly into me, past my skin and bones, through my ribs, and into my blood.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Ore asked if I could live with myself; I don’t know. But if I had to do it all over again-” I said, looking down toward the grey tactical command console. “I would.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I don’t know if that is what space is for. I don’t know if I regret longing to touch the stars as a child, if it was my imagination that led me here, to Intrepid. I don’t know if I’ll ever find solace in the night again. But there is one thing I am certain of: that I would. I would do it all again if I had to.

        <!-- <h1 class="narrativeNonfictionTitleTest storyTwo">The Rift</h1>
         <div class="gradientGalloDelCielo"><p>PART 1</p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sovereign exited her slipstream, a wake of distortion trailing behind her, corrupting the starlight into shades of cascading light, like embers floating above a fire pit. Those thousands of colors lit the view screen, throwing light about the bridge and onto the consoles. They painted my uniform a magnificent purple. I had to squint for a moment before the computer adjusted the displayed exposure; it stained colors onto my retinas that appeared when I blinked. The rift was unlike anything I’d ever seen; it was magnificent. The hideous creation of our own destructiveness, our own evil, yet magnificent.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The sharp chime of the proximity alert than suddenly rung although no objects were detected on optical readings. I blinked faster to rid my eyes of the remnants of her slipstream wake.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I reached towards the steering knob, still squinting, and turned to port. Sovereign began to slowly roll when a piercing crash thundered through her vacant halls. I was thrown to the cold floor below, my blood now staining her pristine navigation console. The bridge instantly illuminated red and the shriek of the emergency siren wailed behind me. Bright pulses struck her impulse engines, tearing violent gashes into the two massive exhaust ports. The emergency siren’s wail morphed into a low hum as its sound merged with the crumpling of Sovereign’s hull.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I brought myself to my feet and treaded to the tactical station. Shields were offline and a weapons lock was not possible to establish due to the rift’s interference. The chilling cold burned my eyes; emergency power was rerouted from climate control to the ablative hull. I squinted more, practically closing my eyes entirely, as I searched for the automatic firing menu on the tactical console.
            <br><br><br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The pulses continued to light the abyss, coloring the once grey Sovereign a charcoal black. Microfractures along her ridged frame deformed metal, spilling cold blackness inside her buckled hull as crumpled bits flew off into space.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  I couldn’t bear to stand any longer; the frigidness engulfed me and I toppled to the ground. The bridge became a series of orbs, glowing and pulsating in my vision. I closed my eyes again, unable to open them under the weight of the air flowing throughout the shattered bridge vents.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The coldness unraveled me in my dream world; I saw people I knew, faces I’d never thought I’d see again. They all seemed so real, so alive. I reached out towards my mother’s open hand, her expression so warm and fuzzy. She smiled and faintly laughed as she faded into dust before me. Her essence fell through the cracks between my fingers and out the open wounds of Sovereign into the blackness of space. And then all I could see was that blackness, I traveled with it. It flowed over me like waves upon a calm beach, caressing my shivering body in that encompassing darkness.

            <p>PART 2</p>


            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I awoke to clanging. Metal against metal. I was struck by something and the world slowly returned to normality; the blackness of the universe was gone. I knew that I was struck yet I did not experience the sensation of it. It was as if the object which had hit me simply flowed to my head and trickled down me like water from a spout. I opened my eyes carefully, feeling grains of sand fall from my eyelids onto the floor below me. There was more sand clinging to my stiffened hair, which I shook to release, causing it to flutter to the ground. The tarps which comprised the room I was held in flapped tirelessly from the storm outside.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Looking up from the sandy mess below, I caught the eyes of two men peering down upon me. One was incredibly tall, perhaps the tallest man I’d ever seen and the other was comparably unremarkable, apart from his artificial leg. I jolted and thrashed, unable to move from the chair from which I was chained. The two men did not flinch as I squirmed before them.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Earthman…” the tall one said. His voice was raspy and old. “What brings you to the Xerosic Rift?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I did not respond.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What do you think we are, cadet? Morons? We see your pins. I know that you are an alpha squadron cadet. Believe me, I’ve studied your people and your culture. I know who you and your organization are,” the legless one said, taking a kneeling position in front of me as he looked curiously into my squinting eyes. He flicked my cheek and sand tumbled down from my head.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Now, I understand the Coalition is becoming increasingly desperate, but desperate enough to allow a single cadet to pilot a Sovereign-class? What exactly would a student, even an Alpha Squadron cadet, need to use a Coalition warship for in a scientific research expedition?”
A faint buzz interrupted the legless man and he began to twitch his head, clearly annoyed.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	“WHAT,” he yelled in reply to the interruption.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “New assessment,” someone from behind the flapping tarp said shyly.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	The legless man sighed, rolling his eyes as he made after the tall one in swiftly exiting the humdrum compound through the rattling wooden door, leaving a battering trail of dust in their wake. That dust reeked of alcohol. The door continued to rattle even after they had exited, sand flowing from under and above into the room and then slamming the door shut again. It was a cyclical process; the sand entering and the door closing.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Before I could blink again, the door had opened and shut, in with it not only did sand come but the two figures I’d just met as well. The tall man cleared his throat and looked down upon me.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You’re free to go. But, Earthman, this out here, this ain’t no Earth.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I nodded and kept my eyes low. The whirring sand made them irritable and the faint outline of the many colors of the rift still pierced my retina. I made special care to not kick up any sand as I headed to the door. At the moment, I couldn’t feel anything. I wasn’t confused, I wasn’t scared, I wasn’t hopeful; I felt nothing and had no questions. I pushed open the creaking wooden door and finally caught glimpse of the outside world. The sand was overpowering, it hurled in every direction, obfuscating the universe around that compound, gushing over my face and hands, slashing my skin like a whip. I couldn’t bear to open my eyes any longer. I simply experienced the sand as it felt; not as it looked.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Earthman,” someone yelled from behind me. I hadn’t heard their voice before. I stood deathly still and extended my arms. I knew that combat would be impractical in these conditions yet my arms still stood outstretched, perhaps a facet of my questioning instinct or my training, or maybe both.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Yes? Who’s there?” I inquired.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Beans.” the voice replied, clearly higher in tone. I almost thought it was my mother; my mother saying that beans are here, in the middle of a sandstorm God knows where on some planet in the Xerosic  Rift.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What do you mean?” I replied.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Beans’ here, that’s what.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “And you’re Beans?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “No, Earthman, I’m Earthwoman.” The voice inched closer, becoming progressively softened with every inch of distance closed between it and me.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “But yes, I’m also Beans. The rift is quite odd isn’t it?” No longer did it yell; it merely talked to me.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I don’t understand.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “And you’re Beans?”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “No, Earthman, I’m Earthwoman.” The voice inched closer, becoming progressively softened with every inch of distance closed between it and me.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “But yes, I’m also Beans. The rift is quite odd isn’t it?” No longer did it yell; it merely talked to me.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I don’t understand.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You will.” I could hear it directly behind me, almost at a whisper. If not for the sand, I would probably have been able to feel its breath on the nape of my neck.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was frozen. Part of me distrusted it but part of me, perhaps the son in me, trusted that voice beyond anything I’ve trusted before.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I felt its hand slowly rest on my shoulder. I did not shrug it off, I did not resist its unspoken offer of assistance. By God, out here, I could use any assistance I could find.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Follow me,” she said. I did.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I traced her steps methodically through the sand. I inferred that she had some device to allow her to see through this blinding storm or she was simply adept to it from years of exposure. I did not have grounds upon which to question her intentions; she was the one with eyes - I was no better than blind in these conditions. Even if she did intend to use me to extract information about the Coalition, it would be better to find that out when we reached our destination.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Where are we going?” I asked.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Home.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Your home, I take it.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Yes, my home. Well, not my house, but my home.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She spoke in tongues, at least that’s what it seemed like to me. Whether this was a facet of intelligence or stupidity I did not know. We continued uphill. The sand flowing through the raging tunnel-like wind pierced my face, probably creating streaks of red slashed blood across it. I couldn’t see nor could I feel them if they were even there, but I imagined that they were. For a moment, as we trekked uphill and onward through the blistering sand, the war was not a thought. It coursed over me like the darkness of space, like the sand, battering me but ultimately tumbling off my shoulders upon the rocky cliff below.

            <br><br><br><br>
<p>PART 3</p>
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Her open palm left my back and I stood still. I could make out her footsteps against the raging sand storm as she passed before me, for the first time in several hours. I was now the one behind her, her back to me. A faint buzz rang and I heard a loud vault-like door unlock and creak open. Slowly.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Forward,” Beans said. And forward I went. “Watch your step.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The cascading sand, like small embers, slowly began to fade as I entered the vault, their sound dimming until I could finally hear my own breath; it was deep but not scared. Beans, however, was silent. I wiped the sand from my eyes and shook my head rapidly. It flew off in every direction and I heard a faint chuckle from her.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The world unraveled before me as I opened my eyes, light flowing into them like the sand from my head flowing on the ground. Colors flew about in my brain, ricocheting off the wall of my skull and fluttering about. I had to focus my vision to make out anything beyond the orbs of light which came as a result of my tiredness and of my eyes temporarily withdrawing from visual stimulation for the past several hours. They craved the satisfaction of beauty.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I stood inside a giant metal compound. Below me there was grass, but far off in the distance, I could see the faint silhouette of towering buildings, all underneath this giant metal roof, a roof that stretched miles. Thousands of artificial light tiles lit a prairie underneath that massive roof. They mimicked a blue sky overhead, the kind of sky I’d become so intimately familiar with back on Earth.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I’ve never seen the sky before,” Beans said. I looked behind me, realizing I’d never actually seen her face. Our eyes locked as I did. They were a deep brown; very serious eyes. Her stern look matched her stern tone. Her hair too was brown and ragged, but that was probably due to the sand. She looked like me, she looked like my mother.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What do you mean?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Well, I’ve never been off this rock before. Since the day I was born, the only light I’ve ever seen has been from those panels. The only grass I’ve known has been from this prairie. If you can even call it that. You’re from Earth; have you ever been to a prairie? A real prairie? Have you ever seen the real grass, touched it, smelled it?” I took a seat beside her, atop a grass mound, and stretched my legs outward.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “I never thought I’d see something more beautiful than the Aurora Borealis. My mother used to work at a research outpost up north on Earth. It was probably the most isolated, the most secluded place on the planet. She was a very solitary woman, my mother. When I opened my eyes here, the dancing colors from those blue panels and the calm swaying grass blades here. I don’t know, but the experience of seeing for the first time, seeing life after seeing nothing but darkness for a day, was something more beautiful than I can describe. I wouldn’t say this place is any less real than the prairies on Earth, any less real or less beautiful than the Aurora Borealis.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “But have you seen a real prairie?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “No, I suppose I haven’t.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beans took a seat beside me. There was no sound but the faint hum of sand upon the outside of the compound’s clanging metal sheet. Nobody else seemed to reside within the compound.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What is this place?” I asked her.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “My home,” she replied. She was back to speaking in tongues.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “It’s a pretty big home.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “124, that’s how many live here. The place was built to house 50,000. 40 years ago we just about had that many. It’s sad what you Earth people have done to the Marquis.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She looked up from the ground. Her eyes were heavy.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Just cause we’re caught in the middle of your stupid war. We’re Earth citizens, you remember that. I’m an Earth citizen but I’ve never been to your little utopia. You’re sitting here clean-shaven with your military pips. Your people made the rift and I hope you don’t forget that anytime soon.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked down towards the blades of grass that punctured through the ground’s course surface. I grabbed one, tearing it from the ground, and began to draw circles in the dirt. “Do you know why I am here?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I’m not a presumptive person, so I’ll say no, I don’t know why you’re here,” she replied.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Well, I know why I’m here. The Coalition is desperate. Very desperate. I don’t know how much you or your people are aware of the extent of that desperation, but they began drafting academy cadets to operate military posts. Now, I am, or rather I was, an alpha squadron cadet. We’re the honor division of the academy; the best cadets in the fleet. My crew and I were assigned to an operation by Coalition intelligence.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I now looked up from the ground, my circles littering it in many intricate yet uncoordinated designs. Beans’ gaze did not waver.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You know that the genetically enhanced are banned within the Coalition. On Earth, they’re illegal; they’re hunted and persecuted. To be truthful, the Coalition fears them, fears what they represent. They are a product of our own genius, human genius, and we’ve lived to see the day where that product surpasses us. That’s why we’re now a desperate people. Our own genius has come to bite us in the tail; the specials develop technology at a faster rate than we can combat; within a decade they’ve built facilities and institutions that rival ours that have existed for a thousand years. They are superior to us and the Coalition cannot simply admit that. We do not even acknowledge their personhood. The genetically enhanced, lab-born people, were not conceived out of love as we humans are. They were conceived out of utility, to serve a purpose, and to serve the Coalition. They were made as flesh computers, to increase our efficiency in menial tasks, the kind of tasks that human beings shouldn’t need to waste precious time on. But when you allow specials to operate the same facilities that produce other specials, you create an immensely powerful machine and you create a being that is capable of producing new life. Not new human life, but new life. You create a being that can innovate and that can evolve new characteristics within a single generation. That is a power that the Coalition deeply regrets allotting to Specials and one that will likely be our own demise. So Earth is no Utopia, at least not now. Earth is also no longer in Coalition-occupied space. It’s just another asset in the Special’s array of planets. We created the rift to save our people, to slow their advances. We couldn’t permit the specials to continue to occupy Coalition territory in the amounts that they were.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You saved your people but killed ours.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There was silence for a moment.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “4 billion. That’s how many of our people have been killed as a result of this conflict. Your people may suffer but they’re not all dead.”
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “But we are all dead. Or we will be. We aren’t dying like you Earth people, fast and abruptly. You’ve poisoned us, entrapped us as we die slowly. There is no glory or honor to our slaughter as there is yours,” she replied.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I’m sorry but we had no choice.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “The Coalition abandoned us, its own citizens. You left us to die,” she said, beginning to raise her voice.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “It was either the Marquis or the Coalition. We could either sacrifice a single colony on the outskirts of Coalition space or the entirety of our race.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Who gave you the right to play God? To choose who is deserving of life or death? Who gave you the right to sentence us to death to preserve your utopia?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “What do you think about the specials?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Well, I—”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I don’t care what the Coalition thinks,” she said, interrupting me, “What do you think about them?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I don’t know. Specials are unlike us in many ways. Human beings, we aren’t designed, we aren’t crafted to serve a specific purpose. We’re created out of something… more than the need to fulfill a task. We’re created out of love and—”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Love? What is love?” she asked.  “An instinct. A primitive biological response. The shifting of your moist gears within your jumbles of neurons, telling your body to create children, to mix your genetic material with another human to advance your species. You create without purpose, at the whim of some primitive desire instilled into you millions of years ago. Human beings do not change, they adapt yes but they do not change. What you call love, it existed the same way it does now millions of years ago. And what is love if not selfishness? The desire to have another, to possess them for the purpose of producing your offspring. What if the specials, what if they got it right? They don’t mindlessly continue their species, without consideration for the overarching implications of their impulsiveness. They do not have those same primitive tendencies. They adapt, they change with every new generation. Humanity is still primitive.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “You say that as if you’re not human?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Are specials human?”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Are you a special?” I asked her.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Answer my question,” she answered.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “No. They are not. Now you answer mine.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She turned her head and looked down. The sand outlines like winding paths thrashed through the coursed dirt.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “I know why they created the rift. Why they really created it. I was the reason; well, I was one of them. We were made by Coalition intelligence. Our division, we were tasked with developing new short-range sensor technology. At the time, the Coalition was experimenting with its first classes of dedicated warships. They needed to be small and maneuverable. But to be that, they needed sensors that could establish target locks in a variety of conditions.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “We were stationed in what is now the rift aboard a research outpost station, making these sensors for those new ships. The Marquis raided our outpost, destroying our facility in a fit of rage against the Coalition for abandoning them in the face of war. And so, here I am. A freed special from the secret Coalition research output.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “So you are, a special.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Yes, and I was manufactured by the Coalition for the purpose of producing war machines to kill my own people, my own freed people. I was blindly helping my enemy; you, your people are my enemy.”

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked up at her eyes, which were no longer saddened. They no longer seemed to bear the burden of her guilt. She looked free as if she had been lifted from a great pain. I knew what she was going to do, I had sensed it since her open palm first laid rest upon my back. She slowly reached toward her back, concealed behind her. I hadn’t seen her back before; at only one point I recall sensing her vulnerability. I was blind but I could have saved myself then. Now though, I knew that it was too late.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Those questions I asked you earlier,” she said, her hand no longer moving toward her backside. “I just wanted to see how human you really are."
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “How human I am?” I asked, my voice deep and penetrating.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Very,” she replied, her arm swiftly jolting forward.

            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A thunderous echo reverberated through the metal sheeted walls of the compound yet the plants did not change their sway. The sand did not change its incessant pounding against the fortress walls; there was a certain chaos to it all, a certain unpredictability and insanity to life.

         <h1 class="narrativeNonfictionTitleTest storyThree">The Living City</h1>
         <div class="gradientNature">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ​​The cold breath of morning tinted clear plastic windows grey with foggy residue. I could feel the rusted keel of that New York City water taxi rumbling as it spit chilled Hudson water from behind. Its warm interior and vibrating frame sent a deep and continuous resonance up the backs of the cold metal seats which lined the rocking deck. The sensation was strangely calming; it reminded me of August nights I’d spent stacking tiny sticks atop the flame of a barely-cackling fire, wiping black embers from my eyes.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mere inches beyond that grey tinted shield, the bitter bite of winter whimpered against the scratched plastic. It seemed to grab me by a numb reddened ear, pulling me towards the glistening lights of the early morning skyline. Each building painted the lazy waves of the Hudson varying hues of yellow and white. Every photon emitted from a single fixture in a single room within a single building projected a dot upon the river's rolling surface. Individually, they were nothing more than specks. Together, though, those specks culminated in a great system of vibrant luminescence - visible even from space.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The city itself is a great organism. It breathes, it consumes, it produces, and it lives. Its blood flows underground, in the air, and on the streets, pumping resources through its yellow-lit veins. The city changes over time; it evolves and advances - it becomes better. The city is utterly relentless in its pursuit of perfection. As the rumbling water taxi treaded onwards towards that pulsating beacon of life, I could see through the morning fog the city’s unacknowledging gaze, lit by thousands of narrow and unwavering eyes.

         <div class="gradientEntryOne">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Perhaps the only thing that I'll miss about the 'new normal' is the digitisation of everything. Throughout my time in lower and middle school, and freshman and sophomore years of high school, I have never found myself able to maintain a proper organization system. I would start the year strong with dedicated binders to house all of my papers neatly coupled with notebooks for every class. However, not very far into the year I would find old chemistry quizzes filling my math folder and quadratic functions littering English.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Last year, because of being virtual and as a result of  an administrative effort to reduce the amount of paper used in school, I finally -- even if not necessarily voluntarily -- took the plunge into digital note taking, and straight to the deep end I went. As an already digitally-oriented person, I had a Microsoft 365 subscription and access to all the tools I could ever need before I even entered high school. I stored personal files on OneDrive, occasionally used Word to write documents and used Powerpoint to create presentations. I had also bought an iPad (which I used to type this journal entry and possibly the best investment I’ve made as a student) not long before. Suffice it to say, I was well prepared for digital learning.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Like in years prior, I came into school (or logged in) with my red English folder, black math folder, purple Spanish folder, blue history folder, green science folder, and white miscellaneous folder empty and hungry for material. But no longer would they be shoved carelessly into my backpack with loose papers crumpled and tossed about. Rather, they were stored in some Microsoft server in another state (understandably, Microsoft does not disclose the exact location of their data centers) or in the magical Apple Cloud. Perhaps for the first time in my career as a student, there were no equations in my English notebook, no Spanish vocab in my science folder, and my notes weren’t crudely condensed into a pancake of knowledge at the bottom of my backpack. I developed a simple and intuitive organization and notetaking system that genuinely worked for me and, as strange as it feels to say it, I have the “new normal” to thank for that.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Innovation: a principle driving force of humanity, the difference between us and our animal relatives, a facet of our intelligence. We are driven by our innate desire to innovate in much the same way the robin is driven by innate desire to build a nest: it is instinctual. The difference between us and the robin, however, is that we do not settle; we are not satisfied living in a house of sticks. We are a dissatisfied species and in that dissatisfaction we seek only to improve, inching progressively closer to whatever perfection is. Our technology is the pinnacle of this desire and something that I find to be truly awe-inspiring - not just in what we’ve done, but an awe for what the future holds.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Not even 100 years ago, everyday components of our lives would have been inconceivable; our devices would appear to work by magic. We have literally moulded the natural elements of our world and created something new, something almost indescribably incredible. In the same way that termites build their mounds using dirt and robins build their nests using twigs, we manipulate our natural environment to construct cities and computers. A CPU is literally a chunk of metal that we taught to think! And that metal, over not a very long period of time, became smaller and smaller, and housed more and more transistors and cores until we reached the absolute limit of how small it could get and how much it could hold. So What do we do? We enter the quantum realm. Innovation does not stop. The next generation will continue to improve upon the collective discoveries of all prior generations. It is an innate desire to continually progress towards betterment that I think is applicable to every person. I’ve grown to love watching innovation occur in front of my very eyes and can say that it is definitely one of my favourite things.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Naval architecture has long been a niche interest of mine. Since kindergarten, I’ve marveled at the awe-inducing qualities of well designed and some not so well designed seafaring vessels (my then-favorite ship was the Titanic). This past summer, to celebrate my mother’s 50th birthday, my family went on a short 3 night Caribbean cruise. We were onboard the Freedom of the Seas, which was one of the first ships to leave port since COVID and thus had a severely reduced guest capacity. In actuality, the ship was practically vacant. The crew seemed to outnumber the guests by a ratio of at least 10:1. Our stateroom was the only one occupied in the entire section of our deck. Simply walking through the halls, the bulkheads seemed to span 10 meters wider than they actually were. The entire ship was devoid of people, was devoid of activity, but in that inactivity and apparent lifelessness, the true vastness of the vessel was apparent.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I recall walking across the promenade and forgetting I was even aboard a ship. The colorful lighting fixture sent dancing beams around the empty hall and across a little glass bridge which spanned over the lower levels. The background music almost seemed blaring over the quietness of everything else. Looking up towards the windows of the interior-oriented staterooms, it was like being surrounded by towering apartments, most of which had closed and untouched curtains.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I also remember leaving the ship and staring upwards with an ache in my neck towards it’s immense baby blue hull. I noticed two crew members peeking out from an opening and painting that blue hull with the largest paint roller I’d ever seen. I thought the situation was curious and decided to photograph it. In that photo, the immensity and vastness of the ship is truly visible. The overpowering blueness of the massive vessel encompases the entire frame with the only non-blue elements being the two comparatively tiny people and their bright yellow paint roller. They paint what is already intensely blue in yet another coat of blue.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through symbolism, Tim O’Brien characterizes Jimmy Cross as a deeply burdened soldier, desperately seeking an escape from war through an obsessive fantasy of faux love. Cross’s love for Martha is a deeply embedded facet of his character and O’Brien uses it to display his yearning for home and familiarity. Martha sent letters and other items from America to Cross, which he uses to immerse himself in an adolescent love fantasy and temporarily return to his hometown. In one instance, Martha sent over a pebble which Cross carried in his mouth, physically immersing himself in Martha’s presence and the presence of home. O’Brien uses this image to highlight the disturbingly sexual nature of Cross’s overt obsession for Martha. While carrying the pebble in his mouth, Cross “would slip away into daydreams, just pretending, walking barefoot along the Jersey shore, with Martha…” (4) showcasing his incredible urge to return to the familiarity of home and his becoming aloof in imagining it. The burden Cross experiences as a result of this fantasy is shown when he becomes fixated to the point of neglecting his duties as a lieutenant, eventually resulting in the death of Ted Lavender. Now “this was something he could have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest of the war.” (8) O’Brien again characterizes Jimmy Cross using stones to highlight his mental burdens: like the stone in Cross’s mouth representing his obsessive love from Martha and desire to escape, the burden of Lavender's death -- the ultimate result of that desire -- would be a stone embedded in his stomach and would remain a permanent embedment deep within him.

         <div class="gradientTextOne">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Both Cheryl Strayed and Ta-Nehisi Coates used imagery to elicit a sense of vastness and create awe, an incredibly powerful sense of wonder, in their respective works. In an excerpt of Between the World and Me (pages 39-43), Coates wrote of the wonders of the campus of Howard University. It was a source of awe, being called “Mecca,” in reference to the city where every Muslim takes a pilgrimate to. The campus is, similar to Mecca, a conglomeration of people of vastly different cultures coming together from regions separated by vast distance. Coates writes that  “the vastness of black people across space-time could be experienced in a twenty-minute walk across campus,” (41) describing the cultural vastness encompassing the campus of Howard University. Space-time is perhaps the most vast thing one can imagine, spanning literally everything physically and temporally, and Coates attributes this same vastness to the campus and the individuals who occupy the campus. Coates describes the campus as inducing--through its Mecca-like cultural diversity--the same awe that arises from stargazing and seeing the vastness of space. In a similar manner, Strayed elicits a sense of vastness when describing the natural environment that surrounds her to create awe in Wild. However, this vastness arose from the physical characteristics of the land rather than those who encompassed it, as Coates’ description of the Howard campus did. Strayed used a variety of sensory images to write of the awe-inducing qualities of the forest. Strayed “gazed across the great green expanse,” filling the reader’s imagination with lush foliage spanning miles, and “went days without seeing another person,” further eliciting a sense of isolation and physical vastness. This vastness, just like the expanse of space, creates a sense of wonder and awe in the reader.
